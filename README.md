Smart Doorbell
===
Introduction
---
This project was created for ECE 473 under Professor Shaout and UM-Dearborn. It is a multithreaded C++ application to be run as 
embedded software on a Raspberry Pi that utilizes OpenCV and acts as a doorbell that can:
* Ring when a button is pressed
* Stream video over WiFi using sockets to another UNIX-like device
* Turn a light on when it is dark outside
* Detect motion and save a quick video when motion is detected
* Save the last 24 hours of video all the time
